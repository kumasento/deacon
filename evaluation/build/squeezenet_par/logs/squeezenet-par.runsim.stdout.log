Simulated devices available:
    rz3515b0:rz3515b

To use simulated devices you need to set the environment variables
LD_PRELOAD and MAXELEROSDIR. As LD_PRELOAD must not contain spaces,
you might need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in addition (see the MaxCompiler
tutorial for details).  Also, ensure that you add the correct simulated
system name (namely "rz3515b") to your SLiC configuration. The following
examples assume there are no spaces in LD_PRELOAD or SLIC_CONF.
Example for BASH:
    export MAXELEROSDIR=$MAXCOMPILERDIR/lib/maxeleros-sim
    export LD_PRELOAD=$MAXELEROSDIR/lib/libmaxeleros.so:$LD_PRELOAD
    export SLIC_CONF="$SLIC_CONF;use_simulation=rz3515b"
Example for CSH:
    setenv MAXELEROSDIR $MAXCOMPILERDIR/lib/maxeleros-sim
    setenv LD_PRELOAD $MAXELEROSDIR/lib/libmaxeleros.so:$LD_PRELOAD
    setenv SLIC_CONF "$SLIC_CONF;use_simulation=rz3515b"
