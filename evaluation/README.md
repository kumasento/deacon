# MaxDeep Evaluation

MaxDeep is evaluated by several seperated projects under this folder.
Each project is wrapped in a `package` and listed under `evaluation/src`.
In each evaluation project package, there will be:

1. A customised `Kernel` that wraps components to be tested
2. A `Manager` that manages the kernel
3. A software code snippet to call the functionality to be evaluated.
